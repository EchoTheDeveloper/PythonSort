# Python Sort Project
This is a simple python sorting algorythm. It is not meant for production use of any kind.

## Commands:
When running, you will be asked to enter the length of the array. If you enter a positive integer, it will ask you for numbers that many times. However, there are also built in commands.
### --large-number-test (-lnt)
Entering --large-number-test or -lnt will make a array with a length of 10000 and fill it with random positive integers between 0 and 10000.
### --large-number-test-no-sort (-lntns)
Entering --large-number-test-no-sort or -lntns will do the same as large number test, but will also print out the unsorted array as a test.
